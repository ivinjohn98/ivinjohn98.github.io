I am Shahin John J S, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Texas A&M University. My research is focused on designing efficient streaming algorithms. With a deep passion for algorithms and computational complexity, I aim to develop innovative solutions that will shape the future of computing.

Having spent significant time in the software industry as a backend developer at Tesco Bengaluru, I have had the opportunity to work with technologies like Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, Kafka, ElasticSearch, Couchbase, and Microsoft Azure. This hands-on industry experience has given me a unique perspective on computer science, allowing me to approach my research from practical and real-world angles.

I am passionate about applying my research skills to solve real-life problems and bridge the gap between theory and application. My goal is to design solutions that advance the field of computer science and have a tangible impact on industries and society as a whole.
